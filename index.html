                <p>This website is the very first time i've hosted a server and added content to it through my terminal, intially this text used to be lorem ipsum which is basically a default text for programmers to test websites.</p>

                <p>I've uploaded an image of Cherry MX Switches of all kinds. My website is going to be dedicated to giving people an easy and accessable way of testing the audio and looks of different keyswitches. It will have user reviews to help users decide which keyswitch is the right switch for them.</p>

                <p>The plan reason my website is so important to me is because I myself have come across the problem of being super picky but not having enough knowledge to branch outside of my comfort zone with my keyswitches. I want to not only help others branch out and try new keyswitches but I also want to educate users on all of the vast different kind of keyswitches and hopefully long term give them access to buy the switches directly from the site.</p>
